    "#Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"There are huge differences between classes and modules:- \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Classes are blueprints that allow you to create instances with attributes and bound functionality. Classes support \n",
    "   inheritance, metaclasses, and descriptors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Modules can't do any of this, modules are essentially singleton instances of an internal module class, and all their \n",
    "   globals are attributes on the module instance. You can manipulate those attributes as needed (add, remove and update), \n",
    "   but take into account that these still form the global namespace for all code defined in that module.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   From a Java perspective, classes are not all that different here. Modules can contain more than just one class however; \n",
    "   functions and any the result of any other Python expression can be globals in a module too.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   So as a general ballpark guideline:\n",
    "\n",
    "    . Use classes as blueprints for objects that model your problem domain.\n",
    "    . Use modules to collect functionality into logical units.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then store data where it makes sense to your application. Global state goes in modules (and functions and classes are just \n",
    "   as much global state, loaded at the start). Everything else goes into other data structures, including instances of classes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "  As the doc say.\n",
    "\n",
    "  So a module in python is simply a way to organize the code, and it contains either python classes or just functions. \n",
    "  If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them. For instance, the math module in python \n",
    "  contains just a bunch of functions, and you just call those needed (math.sin). Just have a look at this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "  On the other hand a python class is something similar to a java class, it's only structured in a slightly different way.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "  In python world, module is a python file (.py) inside a package. Package is a folder that has __init__.py in its root. \n",
    "  It is a way to organize your codes physically (in files and folders).\n",
    "\n",
    "  On the other hand, class is an abstraction that gathers data (characteristics) and method (behavior) definitions to \n",
    "  represent a specific type of objects. It is a way to organize your codes logically.\n",
    "  \n",

    "  to represent a specific type of objects. It is a way to organize your codes logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A module can have zero or one or multiple classes. A class can be implemented in one or more .py files (modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "  But often, we can organize a set of variables and functions into a class definition or just simply put them in a .py \n",
    "  file and call it a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Likewise in system design, you can have elaborate logical modeling or just skip it and jump into physical modeling. \n",
    "  But for very complex systems, it is better not to skip the logical modeling. For simpler systems, go KISS.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In Python, users can use attributes of a Class that belongs to the class itself. All the instances of that \n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the Python class attributes and when to use them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let’s start with a simple Circle class:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.pi = 3.14159\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.pi * self.radius**2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def circumference(self):\n",
    "        return 2*self.pi * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Circle class has two attributes pi and radius. It also has two methods that calculate the area and circumference \n",
    "   of a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Both pi and radius are called instance attributes. In other words, they belong to a specific instance of the Circle class. \n",
    "  If you change the attributes of an instance, it won’t affect other instances.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Besides instance attributes, Python also supports class attributes. The class attributes don’t associate with any specific \n",
    "  instance of the class. But they’re shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you’ve been programming in Java or C#, you’ll see that class attributes are similar to the static members, but \n",
    "  not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To define a class attribute, you place it outside of the __init__() method. For example, the following defines pi \n",
    "  as a class attribute:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Circle:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.pi * self.radius**2\n",
    "\n",
    "    def circumference(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * self.pi * self.radius\n",
    "     \n",
    "    After that, you can access the class attribute via instances of the class or via the class name:\n",
    "\n",
    "   object_name.class_attribute\n",
    "   class_name.class_attribute\n",
    "   Code language: Oracle Rules Language (ruleslanguage)\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the area() and circumference() methods, we access the pi class attribute via the self variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Outside the Circle class, you can access the pi class attribute via an instance of the Circle class or directly \n",
    "   via the Circle class. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c = Circle(10)\n",
    "print(c.pi)\n",
    "print(Circle.pi)\n",
    "Code language: Python (python)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "  3.14159\n",
    "  3.14159\n",
    "  \n",
    "  How class attributes work:-\n",
    "  \n",
    "  When you access an attribute via an instance of the class, Python searches for the attribute in the instance \n",
    "  attribute list. If the instance attribute list doesn’t have that attribute, Python continues looking up the attribute \n",
    "  in the class attribute list. Python returns the value of the attribute as long as it finds the attribute in the instance \n",
    "  attribute list or class attribute list.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  However, if you access an attribute, Python directly searches for the attribute in the class attribute list.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Test:\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.x = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "test = Test()\n",
    "print(test.x)  # 20\n",
    "print(Test.x)  # 10\n",
    "\n",
    "  How it works:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Test class has two attributes with the same name (x) one is the instance attribute and the other is a class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  When we access the x attribute via the instance of the Test class, it returns 20 which is the variable of the instance \n",
    "  attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, when we access the x attribute via the Test class, it returns 10 which is the value of the x class attribute.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by objects. Every object has its own copy of the \n",
    "   instance attribute (In case of class attributes all object refer to single copy).\n",
    "\n",

    "  1. vars()– This function displays the attribute of an instance in the form of an dictionary.\n",
    "  2. dir()– This function displays more attributes than vars function,as it is not limited to instance. It displays the \n",
    "  class attributes as well. It also displays the attributes of its ancestor classes.\n",

    "   We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. The user can notice \n",
    "   that the same inbuilt operator or function is showing different behaviour for objects of different classes. \n",
    "   This process is known as operator overloading.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print (14 + 32)  \n",
    "       \n",
    "    # Now, we will concatenate the two strings  \n",

    "  Suppose the user has two objects which are the physical representation of a user-defined data type class. The user \n",
    "  has to add two objects using the \"+\" operator, and it gives an error. This is because the compiler does not know how \n",
    "  to add two objects. So, the user has to define the function for using the operator, and that process is known as \"operator \n",
    "  overloading\". The user can overload all the existing operators by they cannot create any new operator. Python provides \n",
    "  some special functions, or we can say magic functions for performing operator overloading, which is automatically invoked \n",
    "  when it is associated with that operator. Such as, when the user uses the \"+\" operator, the magic function __add__ will \n",

    "#Q9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is built around the idea of having objects that belong to a particular type. \n",
    "   In a sense, the type is what explains us the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Everything in Python is an object and every object has a type. These types are declared and defined using classes. \n",
    "  Thus, classes can be considered as the heart of OOP.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In order to develop robust and well-designed software products with Python, it is essential to obtain a comprehensive \n",
    "  understanding of OOP. In this article, we will elaborate on two key concepts of OOP which are inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Both inheritance and polymorphism are key ingredients for designing robust, flexible, and easy-to-maintain software. \n",
    "  These concepts are best explained via examples. Let’s start with creating a simple class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Employee():   def __init__(self, emp_id, salary):\n",
    "      self.emp_id = emp_id\n",
    "      self.salary = salary  def give_raise(self):\n",
    "      self.salary = self.salary * 1.05\n",
    "\n",
    "   We have created a class called Employee. It has two data attributes which are employee id (emp_id) and salary. \n",
    "   We have also defined a method called give_raise. It applies a 5-percent increase on the salary of an employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We can create an instance of the Employee class (i.e. an object with Employee type) and apply the give_raise method \n",
    "   as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   emp1 = Employee(1001, 56000)print(emp1.salary)\n",
    "   56000emp1.give_raise()print(emp1.salary)\n",
    "   58800.0\n",
    "\n",
    "   OOP allows us to create a class based on another class. For instance, we can create the Manager class based on the \n",
    "   Employee class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  class Manager(Employee):\n",
    "     pass\n",
    "     \n",
    "  In this scenario, Manager is said to be a child class of the Employee class. The child class copies the attributes\n",
    "  (both data and procedural) from the parent class. This concept is called inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It is important to note that inheritance does not mean copying a class. We can partially inherit from a parent \n",
    "   (or base class). Python also allows for adding new attributes as well as modifying the existing ones. Thus, inheritance comes with a great deal of flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We can now create a manager object just like we create an employee object.\n",
    "\n",
    "  mgr1 = Manager(101, 75000)\n",
    "  print(mgr1.salary)\n",
    "  75000 \"\"\""
